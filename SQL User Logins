SQL User Logins

Your table: maintable_QR5FK
MySQL version: 5.5.56-log

In this MySQL challenge, the table provided shows all new users signing up on a specific date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
Your query should output the change from one month to the next. 
Because the first month has no preceding month, your output should skip that row. 
Your output should look like the following table. 

/* write your SQL query below */

SELECT MONTHNAME(DateJoined) Month,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM maintable_QR5FK t2
    WHERE MONTH(t2.DateJoined)=MONTH(t.DateJoined))
  -
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM maintable_QR5FK t2
    WHERE MONTH(t2.DateJoined)=MONTH(t.DateJoined)-1)
  MonthToMonthChange
FROM maintable_QR5FK t
GROUP BY Month
HAVING Month<>'January'
ORDER BY MONTH(DateJoined)
